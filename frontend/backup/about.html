            <strong>PlanesNear.Me</strong> is a web application designed to help people to know what airplanes are flying near their location in real time. By leveraging geolocation data and an API for tracking aircraft, the platform provides a quick way to explore nearby planes based on a specified radius.

        <h2>Who Created It & Why?</h2>
        <p><em>PlanesNear.Me</em> was built by <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samlalonde/" target="_blank">Sam Lalonde</a></strong> using ChatGPT.</p>
        <p>I have no prior experience making "web apps" let alone using Flask. My Python skills are very much entry-level beginner. This project took an afternoon to ideate, develop, and publish. Seriously, I think it took around 5 hours including breaks.</p>
        <p>My friends and I are always interested in what planes are overhead and this is a quicker way for us to quickly see what's flying overhead.</p>
        <p>This is a simple tool but it highlights the power of ChatGPT-assisted web development by a relatively non-technical individual. This is an example of someone thinking "wouldn't it be neat if..." and then turning out a product in an afternoon.</p>
        <p>If you care to know more about me: Sam is a digital marketing professional with over a decade of experience in sales, project, product, and campaign management across performance channels like paid media, affiliate, SEO, programmatic, and CRM. You can connect with him on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samlalonde/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.
